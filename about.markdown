Hello, Iâ€™m Martin and am honored to work for the [Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod](http://www.wels.net/) (WELS) with some very talented and dedicated Christian team members. I live in Slinger, Wisconsin, enjoy photography, graphic design, web/mobile app development, running, hiking, tennis and golf.

I serve Jesus by finding and sharing intersections between technology and Christian ministry in hopes that more and more may know Him. I produce a podcast called [WELSTech](http://welstech.wels.net/) that shares what I find.

With my lovely wife Debbie I attend [Christ Lutheran Church](http://www.christbigbend.com/) in Big Bend, WI. We enjoy a good wine, hiking, photographry, riding our e-bikes, and our two grandchildren.

Connect with me on [Twitter](Https://twitter.com/mspriggs), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinspriggs), or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/martinaspriggs) to just chat, talk about life in Christ, or your latest technology projects. You can also read my latest writings on this site.

Have a blessed day!
